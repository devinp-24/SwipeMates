# SwipeMates Project Approach and Task Division

## Approach:
We'll adopt an end-to-end method where every team member will be involved in all aspects of the project, including frontend development, backend development, database management, testing, and quality assurance. This approach ensures that everyone gains exposure to different parts of the project and fosters collaboration and knowledge sharing within the team. We have decided to put 10 hours each per week for this project, scheduling regular meetings when necessary.
